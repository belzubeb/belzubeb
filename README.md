# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Muhamad Akhdan Najib!  
## ðŸš€ Future CTO (InsyaAllah)

I'm a student developer who loves turning **coffee** (and sometimes snacks) into **code**.  
Specializing in **Java** and **Kotlin** for mobile apps, and occasionally battling with **HTML** on the web.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Up To:
- Dreaming about learning **SwiftUI** (but first, I need a Mac).  
- Learning, coding, and dreaming about **building a startup** (but only if my wallet agrees).  
- Debugging life's code one bug at a time.

## ðŸŽ¯ Ultimate Goal:  
To go from *"Hello World!"* to *"Hello CEO!"* ðŸš€
